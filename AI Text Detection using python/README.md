## Description

This repository contains a Python program that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine whether a given paragraph was generated by AI or written by a human. The program utilizes the `transformers` library and a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to make an educated guess about the origin of the text.

Please note that this approach provides a basic starting point for detecting AI-generated content and may not be entirely accurate.

## Features

- Utilizes the `transformers` library for text classification tasks.
- Employs a pre-trained sentiment analysis model for classification.
- Offers a configurable confidence threshold for AI-generated text identification.
- Demonstrates a simplified approach to distinguishing between AI and human-generated paragraphs.
- Provides insights into the challenges and limitations of AI text detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `transformers` library (install using `pip install transformers`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/

## Install the required libraries

pip install transformers

## Run the AI text detection program


python AITextDetector.py


## Disclaimer
This program's accuracy in identifying AI-generated text may vary, as AI text generation techniques continue to advance. This repository serves as a foundation for exploring the intersection of AI and natural language understanding.
